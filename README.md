App Development project.  Credits to William Cabell, Madison Pippert, and Akshata Pisharody.

This Unity project is a game exploring the meaning (or rather the lack thereof) in the endless grinding one finds in many video games. It was built as a project for the App Development senior seminar at Maggie Walker Governor's School during the 2016-2017 school year.
